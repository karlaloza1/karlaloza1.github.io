							<p>At Cal Hacks, my team and I wanted to create a dance dance revolution game using a single RGB camera for 2d pose estimation. Using a pre-trained CNN on the MPII dataset we can detect up to 14 different joint articulations and compare the sum of square differences between player1 and player2  <p>

							<p>Tools: We used OPENCV to compress 1920x1080p frames down to 340x270p and fed through a pre-trained CNN using the eldar/pose-tensorflow library<p>

							<p>At one Hackathon, my team and I wanted to create a mobile app that will help with the communication between management and workers in agriculture fields. The app will notify if workers are leaving town, information about housing, inform if the crew needs more workers and where they need to go. Workers and managers can modify the information in the app such as job openings, change of seasons, etc. <p>

							<p>Tools: Built with Ionic on the mobile side. Django was used to handle the back end and we hosted the app on Heroku.<p>

							<p>As a final project I created the back end of a game.The game of Hookemon is about taking care of a creature, which needs to be feed, bath and play with. The player can create different creatures in order to make them play with each other. The creatures can fight and play with each other. I showcase the program at our Computer Science Fair in Folsom Lake College .  </p>
							

							<p>Tools: In order to write the program I used the programming language of  C++ and C. I was able to use Object Oriented programming.  </p>

							<p>After receiving a class related to Neural Nets, I decided to create an AI that can recognize which word is from what group. I divide two groups of words and then the AI reads from a text file and pick which word is from what group.  </p>
