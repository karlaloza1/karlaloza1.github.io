											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am an international student from Ecuador, a small country in South America. I discovered my passion for technology at a young age, which motivated me to pursue a Computer Science degree. I am a highly responsible, organized, and self-motivated person. I have experience in technological resources, which helps me with the management of projects. I enjoy serving the community and getting involved in college activities because I enjoy motivating and encouraging other people.</p>
