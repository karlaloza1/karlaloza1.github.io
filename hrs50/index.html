									<h5>
									
										Wellness is important to achieving our goals in life. I believe in self-improvement, hard-work, continuous learning, and self-care. It is important to
										eat well and exercise for maintaining my health of myself and others. As a Computer Science major, I tend to neglect my sleep and rest but I have been
										more serious about resting and not overworking my body. For me, it is important to manage stress by stopping and looking around all the beauty in nature.
										However, wellness for me is more than nutrition and exercise. I believe is important to be aware of our mental health, feeling, memories, desires, 
										and thoughts. I am from Ecuador, a small country in South America, where education, technology, and opportunities are scarce. One of my biggest motivations
										is technology and encourage minorities to study technical degrees because I did not have that opportunity growing up. Also, wellness for me means family 
										and support. Most of my family is in Ecuador, I believe is important to keep connections and show people you care even if you are far away from home. 
										Finally, I believe in healing because for wellness we need to take a break and take care of ourselves with little things such as listening to music, 
										cooking, exploring the world, etc. For me, this is my wellness.
